### 2022 - NodeJS **Authentication Layer NPM package.**

Made a tiny npm package that makes it easy to implement JWT or PassportJs within any NodeJS project. As of now, you can only use MongoDB. Was interesting to build but came across Database issues that made me abandon the project.

Contains:

- Users collection and DB queries prebuilt + test routes.
- custom registration of users using Email.
- ability to choose JWT or passport as the authentication strategy + test routes for strategy functions and logic,
- prebuilt methods and logic accessible for all authentication strategies.
- access to adding more properties to the Users collection model.
